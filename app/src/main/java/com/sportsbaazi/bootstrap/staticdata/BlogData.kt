        "\n" +
        "From Storm to Uncharted Territory\n" +
        "The 2007 T20 World Cup saw India come into the showpiece event of the shortest format (a year before a certain Indian Premier League came into rival its precedence) with a cumulative T20 experience of 1 solitary game. The team was coming from a chastening 2007 World Cup in the West Indies and an ODI series defeat against England. There were even rumours that the Indian team was against the idea of participating in the T20 World Cup, still reeling from the aftermath of the World Cup. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The old turks in Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid took a backseat from the tournament with the intent to give the next generation the license to play with freedom. As a result, Indian cricket required a reset to match modern cricket and the T20 World offered an option to test the waters with a new-look side and a refreshed approach. It meant India went into the tournament relying on skill and intent over valuable experience.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Except for Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh, under MS Dhoni, India came into the tournament with no experience or expectations other than testing out whether this team can play cohesively without fear. Cohesively and without fear they did as teams did not know what to expect of this exuberant new Indian lineup. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Penchant for Drama \n" +
        "With the first game washed out against Scotland, India had it all to do against arch-rivals Pakistan to qualify for the Super 8 stage.  \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But their start was anything but positive as the team slumped to 36/4 inside the powerplay. It seemed like Dhoni’s men were set to be relegated to another chastening exit from a World Cup to continue a summer of misery for the Indians. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But Robin Uthappa and MS Dhoni steadied the ship for the Indians to guide them to a competitive total of 141/7. Pakistan’s chase provided drama and unexpected twists in every course of their quest for India’s target as they huffed and puffed their way to tie the match. What ensued was an unprecedented bowl-out, akin to a penalty shootout in football, which India somehow won emphatically. To help people who might not understand the gravity of the victory, India’s bowling combo only had Harbhajan Singh as the recognized bowler, but that didn’t stop them from hitting the target every time they stepped up to the plate. Whereas Pakistan’s trio of Umar Gul, Shahid Afridi and Yasir Arafat missed all their chances at the stumps to give India a famous victory, perhaps the last time we will ever see a tie being decided in that manner. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The drama would follow the Indian team wherever they went. From Sreesanth's overcooked celebration of smacking the ground after dismissing the dangerous Matthew Hayden in the semifinal to the dramatic skirmish reserved for the showpiece final against Pakistan where it took a moment of madness from Misbah-ul-Haq to give India a win to remember for eternity. \n" +
        " \n" +
        "Yuvraj’s World Cup \n" +
        "Speaking of drama, who can forget when Andrew Flintoff had a rush of blood to the head and squared up to Yuvraj Singh in India’s second Super 8 game against England? What happened after made people turn up and perhaps think for the first moment that this team could go onto special things. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yuvraj put Stuart Broad to the guillotine to hit a historic six sixes in an over. They say the best thing about time is that it changes. With each passing six in the over, the tide of time turned in favour of India and the left-handed southpaw was front and centre of this new Indian team’s attitude of taking the attack to the opposition. Key to Yuvraj’s performances was that he stepped up at the right time, after India lost their opening Super 8 game against New Zealand and needed to win every game from there onwards to qualify for the semifinal. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "As the tournament progressed, Yuvraj led the Indian team’s charge with his aggressive batting. He symbolized the changing intent of this young Indian team who would no more roll over and cower away into a corner, but fight when their backs are to the wall. Cut to the semifinal against Australia and India was in a spot of bother at 41/2 in 8 overs when Yuvraj stepped out with a swagger befitting his name (meaning ‘Prince’) before reducing the Australian bowlers, once the nightmare of many into mere bowling machines enroute to a 30-ball 70 with the highlight of his knock was a flick off Brett Lee that sent the ball soaring 119m into the crowd. It led India to a strong total which proved to be 15 runs too many for a strong Australian batting lineup. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Yuvraj’s performance in that semifinal provided a huge psychological victory against a team which brings out its best in ICC tournaments and whenever the big occasion arises. More importantly, it characterized the ascendancy of Dhoni’s men to a new era in Indian and global cricket, an era where India would also have a say in global cricket’s biggest moments, evidenced by their World Cup triumph four years later where they would again win against Australia with Yuvraj once playing the key role. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Bringing the noise everywhere they go \n" +
        "Another key reason for the World Cup having India as its centrepiece was the huge fanfare that followed the Indian team. With South Africa having a strong Indian community and with related iconic figures leading their fight against colonial rule, the relations between the two nations have always blossomed. As a result, the Indian team enjoyed full houses wherever they played and had the support of the crowd and a nation that just wanted to enjoy the experience of watching them in full tilt. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "It would be a trend that would help India even in their victorious 2013 Champions Trophy campaign. With a team not having the burden of expectations and with a passionate fanbase behind them, the Indian team went into the tournament without the fear of defeat. Conversely, it could’ve also affected the Indian team to prove the world wrong by bouncing back from the horrors of the World Cup six months ago to script an iconic title win. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Either way, the support of fans in sport can never be understated and that was felt during India’s miraculous campaign in the 2007 T20 World Cup. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "What are some reasons that you think made the 2007 T20 World Cup all about India? Let us know in the comments. \n" +

val canShivamDubeyContentSummary = "It was 104/1 in the 10th over and smooth sailing for the Chennai Super Kings against the Gujarat Titans. Local lad Sai Kishore, one among five Tamil-origin players plying their trade at the Titans, five more than the team from their home state and representing the city where they ply their trade in the domestic circuit, was also among a slew of Titans’ bowlers not having their best day with the SG. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Tamilnadu Ranji captain had dropped a dolly of CSK skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad at slip in the 1st over of the match but made amends for it by dismissing Ajinkya Rahane with a ball that spun more than the experienced Mumbaikar would’ve liked. It signalled a critical stage in the innings where the Titans seemed to finally concoct a plan to get back at the Super Kings. They were masters of this craft, capable of pulling back match situations, as evidenced by their miraculous win against the Mumbai Indians just two days ago. With Ashish Nehra on the touchlines in his traditional football manager style, things seemed to finally take a turn for the Titans, like Sai Kishore’s delivery to dismiss Rahane. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But in walked a fellow Mumbaikar in Shivam Dube, a man whose resurgence in T20 cricket is one among many case studies associated with the quality of man-management at CSK. A man capable of taking the attack to the opposition, Dube’s initial rise was marred by many years in the wilderness of the IPL, despite the odd big hit here and a knock there, Dube’s potential hardly ever saw the day of light consistently. Now at CSK though, the 30-year-old looks like a flower that’s found its way out from the shade into the sun and blossoms in the basking sunshine of summer (no Yellow reference there). \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Seeing a spinner at the other end, Dube took no time in setting himself and his intent, smacking Sai Kishore over long on for a six off his first ball. Seeking another way around, Kishore came around the wicket, but Dube had him in his sights from miles out, the second ball on the pads, Dube sat and packed all his strength into a sweep that sent the ball soaring 90m over midwicket for a second six. Dube had raced to 12 runs without breaking a sweat and more importantly, snuffed out any consequence of resurgence from the Titans. It would be a highlight throughout his 24-ball-51 that proved to be the difference on the night as CSK notched their second straight win at home. "

        "Yuvraj Singh Lite \n" +
        "Dubbed “Yuvraj Singh Lite” by Ravichandran Ashwin (That guy with the YouTube channel. Oh, and 500+ test wickets as well) for his pyrotechnics with the bat, similar to that of the dasher from Punjab in his heydays. Dube has been a revelation for CSK in the middle order with his batting prowess and his ability to chip in with the ball when required. His performances over the last two years in T20s have already led to shouts within the wider cricketing community to have Dube as an option for India in the upcoming T20 World Cup. But does he have what it takes to claim a spot in the ever-burgeoning Indian middle order? \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But more important is the question, based on the epithet he’s been given, can Dube replicate the herculean feats of his peer, who was a matchwinner in his own right during his time in the international circuit? Let’s take a look. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dube’s record in 2023-24 \n" +
        "\n" +
        "It’s safe to say that Dube has enjoyed a stellar period over the last two years. It started with joining the Chennai Super Kings who gave him a free role at #5, which played to Dube’s strengths. The freedom in approach has helped Dube play his natural attacking game rather than play with the intent of amassing runs and being the aggregator for the team (a role more suited to top-order batsmen). \n" +
        "\n" +
        "What resulted was a spike in his strike rates, which hovered around the early 120s to shoot up to 158, and currently 166 in this year’s Indian Premier League, marking him among the most destructive batsmen in the league.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Add to that, the southpaw was also the second-highest run scorer for Mumbai in the 2023 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, although he only chipped in with 190 runs at a strike rate of 130, not a number you associate with someone of Dube’s ability. But the case could be made that Dube was batting lower down the order compared to his free-flowing position at CSK. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dube has impressed so far in T20s in 2024. Could he get a spot in India’s T20 World Cup squad? (Credit: @CricCrazyJohns - X)\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dube has been in supreme format in the shortest format in 2024, scoring three half-centuries in just five games (including IPL). The 30-year-old was named Man of the Series in the last T20I series against Afghanistan where he showed his quality not only with the bat but also with the ball. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "In the last two editions of the IPL (till the game against Gujarat Titans on 27th March), Dube’s tally of 503 runs is the third-highest among CSK batsmen (after Devon Conway and Ruturaj). What’s better, those runs have come at a strike rate of 160!\n" +
        "\n" +
        "With the flexibility of the Impact Sub option, CSK can also keep Dube fresh for his big-hitting exploits without having to burden him with bowling and fielding responsibilities. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dube vs Yuvraj in T20s \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Now 30, Shivam Dube is still at an age where he could hit his peak. The Mumbaikar has come good on his destructive ability with his explosive renditions, especially since joining CSK. But what’s often forgotten is his ability to also be useful with the ball. It marks him in a similar vein to his illustrious predecessor Yuvraj Singh, whose precocious batting talents masked his usefulness with the ball in his hand. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dube would need to progressively improve his bowling abilities. He showed in the Afghanistan series that he can contribute with the ball, but to get into the Indian T20I lineup, he would need to considerably prove his versatility to get the nod ahead of players like Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "While he has the cushion of the Impact Sub option in the IPL, Dube might be required to regularly bowl and be on the field for India. It remains to be seen how he can build up his fitness and physicality to be of use in the field for the Indians. It would be something he would need to earn his stripes in if he is to match the legacy of Yuvraj, who was not just a consummate batsman, but an electric fielder as well, with a left arm that could. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But all’s not doom and gloom for Dube. The Mumbai marauder has a strike rate of 145.26 in T20Is and 140.58 in T20s, which are way higher than Yuvraj’s 136.38 in T20 internationals and 128.76 in T20s. Dube’s average of 30.69 in T20s is also higher than Yuvraj’s 25.69. As a result, Dube has shown that he is not only a player who can hit big, but can also score a lot at a quicker clip.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What’s more interesting is the IPL careers of the two players. \n" +
        "Dube’s average of 29.77 is more than Yuvraj’s 24.77, \n" +
        "His career strike rate of 143.32, helped by his monstrous performances over the last three seasons for CSK, eclipses that of Yuvraj (129.72) \n" +
        "With 7 half-centuries in just 49 IPL games, Dube is enroute to overcoming the 132 games-13 half centuries feat of Yuvraj in the IPL \n" +
        "\n" +
        "These numbers indicate that Dube’s star is on the rise in the biggest league in world cricket. But when compared with a complete sample size based on what Yuvraj brought to the table with the ball in hand and in the field, he still has a long way to go to match the feats of the Man of the Tournament in the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 World Cup. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "On the Right Track \n" +
        "\n" +
        "More than the numbers, what Dube needs to also bring to the table, like he is currently doing for CSK, is to step up on the big moments consistently. It was a quality that marked Yuvraj from the rest. Be it his knocks in the Super 8 stages and the semifinal of the 2007 T20 World Cup or his performances throughout the 2011 Cricket World Cup, Yuvraj’s legacy stems from him being arguably the most clutch performer in Indian cricket’s history. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "A key part of those performances was Yuvraj’s all-round ability which made him an inextricable part of the Indian lineup, in an era where specialist players were still in demand. But that’s a thing of the past today where even tailenders are expected to be able to carry their bat across formats. As a result, multi-faceted players are more in demand. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Dube can be useful in situations where the team might need an aggressor to finish the innings on a high note or continue a strong start to the innings. But, it remains to be seen if he can also offer versatility beyond wielding the willow, a department in which India is still spoilt for choice. That could very well be the reason that could be decisive in Dube’s inclusion in the squad for the T20 World Cup in the States and the Caribbean. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "While he has started on the right note with the Super Kings, he still has a lot to do to make people notice his performances in the same vein as Yuvraj’s. But he would rather do well for now being “Yuvraj Singh Lite.” Better times await the 30-year-old who continues to impress. \n" +

        "So let’s take a look at five teams that can bury India’s hopes of a second World T20 trophy this year. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Pakistan \n" +
        "We start with India’s arch-rivals, who are not a team to be scoffed at. Pakistan has played the most T20 internationals (231) and were runners-up in the previous edition. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "They also have players who have extensive experience playing in the USA and West Indies with regular participation in the Caribbean Premier League and the Major League Cricket tournaments. As a result, they could have the advantage of better knowledge of the conditions than the Indians. News also emerged that pacer Mohammad Amir, who was part of the victorious squad in the 2009 T20 World Cup, could be in contention for a spot in their squad. His selection adds variety and pace to the already rapid bowling attack of Pakistan. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Amir would relish playing against Rohit Sharma’s men with impressive performances against India. Despite playing only two games against India, the left-arm quick has picked up four wickets at a ridiculous economy rate of 4.14 and an average of just 7.25! \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The 31-year-old also starred in the CPL 2023 edition, picking up 16 wickets in 11 games (third highest) at an economy rate of 6.87 and a strike rate of 12. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Should he make a comeback for the showpiece event, Amir, along with Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf, could form a pace quartet that could wreak havoc on the strong Indian batting lineup (maybe not for a certain man who wears #18 on his back). With the big-ticket game between the two to be played at a brand-new stadium in New York City, conditions would be completely new for both teams and it could very well come down to who reads the pitch and the conditions the best that wins the duel. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Pakistan have not failed to reach the semifinals in only two of the eight T20 World Cup editions so far, having made three finals. As a result, the Babar Azam-led side certainly has the ingredients and knows the recipe for another deep run in the tournament, enroute which they could hurt the chances of their neighbours and sworn rivals. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "New Zealand \n" +
        "The Blackcaps have made the semifinals of the T20 World Cup on four occasions and have always been a team that punches above their weight in major tournaments. They have also been clinical against India in the shortest format’s showpiece event having won all three clashes between the two nations in T20 World Cups. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "As a result, New Zealand are a team well-versed with the chinks in India’s armour and have the personnel to expose them. With Rachin Ravindra impressing across all formats and Finn Allen and Kane Williamson along with the returning Devon Conway (who will return to the World Cup from a finger injury) and Daryl Mitchell, New Zealand have a top order capable of decimating any bowling attack on their day. Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner and Daryl Mitchell also provide handy options with the ball and are brilliant fielders as well. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "In Tim Southee, New Zealand has the highest wicket-taker in T20 internationals and has a good variety of spinners who could exploit the slow, sometimes sluggish surfaces in the West Indies. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "A well-rounded team who were runners-up in the 2020 T20 World Cup and semifinalists in the previous edition, watch out for the Blackcaps once more. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "England \n" +
        "We now have the defending champions who smashed India all over the park in a 10-wicket victory in their semifinal clash enroute to lifting the trophy in the previous edition. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The two-time champions have made the semifinal in all of the previous three editions with two finals appearances and a title (to add to their first in 2010). They have quality stacked across their team with players with a deep batting lineup that can stretch nearly till the end. While concerns may remain about England’s bowling, they conceded more than 140 only once in the previous edition, against India. But that didn’t turn out to be a problem as Alex Hales and Jos Buttler took it upon themselves to make short work of the target, pummelling the Indian bowlers to all corners of the Adelaide Oval. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "With Ben Stokes, Harry Brook and Jos Buttler in charge, England boasts game-changers in every position who could hurt India’s hopes in this year’s T20 World Cup. Players like Hales, Adil Rashid and Phil Salt (another destructive batter) could also add experience of playing in the Caribbean Premier League, and Rashid’s slow, crafty bowling could be crucial in the wickets prepared in the West Indies. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The England team have also brought on Kieron Pollard as an assistant coach for the tournament. A move that would help them a great deal with Pollard’s experience of the Caribbean and T20 cricket at large. They also toured the West Indies for a five-match T20 series late last year which would’ve given them a taste of the conditions in venues such as Trinidad (hosts the 2nd semifinal) and Barbados (hosts the final). \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Despite a poor showing in the Cricket World Cup last year, there is no doubt that the Three Lions will come all guns blazing this year. It puts them once again at the crossroads on India’s route to regain the T20 World Cup title. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Australia \n" +
        "The most successful team in the history of ICC tournaments, Australia just know how to turn up in the big tournaments (yeah, yeah, we aren’t going to talk about that day). \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Mitchell Marsh-led unit possesses one of the most balanced sides in the tournament and knows what it takes to win the big prizes. Their batting would once again revolve around the quality of David Warner and the explosiveness of Glenn Maxwell. Warner, who announced his retirement from ODI and Test cricket, also announced his retirement from T20 international cricket after the World Cup this summer. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The New South Wales man has fared well against India in T20s, scoring 220 runs at an average of 28, but more importantly, at a strike rate of 143. As a result, he would once again be tasked with the role of giving a strong start to the Aussies along with Travis Head, who has arguably been Australia’s best player in limited-overs cricket in the past 24 months. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "In Pat Cummins, Josh Hazelwood and Mitchell Starc, Australia have a world-class pace battery. Meanwhile, the aforementioned Maxwell, along with Adam Zampa would be key with pitches in the West Indies aiding spinners over the past few years. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "India, though, has a good record against the Aussies in T20 World Cups, winning three of their five meetings in the World Cup. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Men in Yellow will play two games at Barbados, the venue for the final. As a result, they would be well-versed with the conditions and could use it to their advantage should they face India in the final. Based on their group stage finish, the duo could clash at the venue even before the Super 8 stage (if India finishes A2 and Australia finishes B1) setting a possible prelude to the big game on 29th June. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Australia’s quality is not just restricted to the match-winning capabilities of their players, but also their ability to read the conditions correctly. It was that sixth sense which helped them overcome India in the World Cup final last year (the less talked about it the better).\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As a result, India would need to be better judges of the conditions and quality of the pitches on offer in the West Indies when they reach the shores of the Caribbean for the Super 8 and Knockout stages. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "South Africa \n" +
        "We move on to the Proteas who could be one of the favourites for the title this year (unless they turn a corner on their ability to flunk on the big stage). For a team blessed with an unending talent pipeline in all three departments, South Africa would be disappointed with their showing in T20 World Cups, having reached the semifinals only twice across the eight editions so far. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But this year, they are a team that looks capable of blowing oppositions out of the park with their quality and depth. Kagiso Rabada, Nandre Burger, Marco Jansen, Anrich Nortje and Gerald Coetzee prop up the tanks for a fiery pace department, while the batting is no slouch with Aiden Markram, David Miller and the explosive Heinrich Klaasen all in readiness. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "South Africa’s batting could very well revolve around the pyrotechnics of Klaasen who has been in regal form in T20s. Since 2023, the 32-year-old has scored at an average of 43 and a dizzying strike rate of 184! If Klaasen has his way, he could very well take the game away from the opposition single-handedly in a very short period. As a result, the Indian bowlers (among all other bowling attacks) need to place a premium on seeing Klaasen’s back as early as possible.  \n" +
        "\n" +
        "A lot could hinge on the performances of the middle order, considering South Africa’s top order lacks a bit of bite, it could lead to the Proteas not having strong starts in their batting. But with world-class personnel to follow, that would be something that wouldn’t worry the Proteas too much. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The left-arm spin duo of Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi would be potent spinning options for the Proteas. Shamsi’s experience of playing in the CPL could also come in handy. South Africa could also be tempted to bring in Dwaine Pretorius, whose cutters and variations in pace could trouble the Indian batsman in the West Indies. Pretorius was also the highest wicket-taker in the previous edition of the Caribbean Premier League, picking up 20 wickets at an economy of 7.1 and a strike rate of just above 13. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "As a result, South Africa boasts the riches of having match-winning personnel in every department, and if they get their act together, they could very well create history by winning their first major international trophy in cricket, at the behest of the Indians. \n" +

        "The T20 format has single-handedly revolutionized the way cricket is played, with teams never shy of making their attacking intentions known.

        "\n" +
        "So let’s take a quick look at 10 records that were set in the T20 World Cup and some that could be broken in the upcoming edition. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Honourable Mention: Most Teams in a Single Edition \n" +
        "The 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup will be the biggest and longest edition in the history of the showpiece event as 20 teams will battle it out to be crowned T20 World Champions. The move represents an increase from the 16-team format that persisted between the 2016, 2020 and 2022 editions. Along with a host nation in the United States, it’s a welcome move that indicates the commitment to promote and improve the global footprint of the game and increase representation. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "It allows new teams and players to express themselves and make their mark on the global stage. The increase in the number of teams marks a bigger and better T20 World Cup with newer and bigger matchups and battles adding to the spectacle of the showpiece event in the shortest format of the game. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "10.) Most T20 World Cup Titles \n" +
        "The latest edition of the T20 World Cup could crown a new champion or add to the tally of the existing powers. Currently, England and the West Indies hold the record for the most titles with two titles apiece. With the quality of the competition, it remains to be seen if England can successfully defend their title and add a third title to their cabinet. It would further increase their dominance in the shortest format of the game. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But with Australia, India and Pakistan winning a title each and well in contention for the title, it remains to be seen if tallies will be furthered or if a win for either of the previous winners puts them alongside the Three Lions or the men from the host nation in the T20 World Cup winners leaderboard. Irrespective, the quality on offer from each of these nations makes it a World Cup you do not want to miss out on. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "9.) Most Wickets in T20 World Cups \n" +
        "The record for the most wickets in T20 World Cups currently is with Shakib al Hasan. The Bangladesh skipper has established himself as one of the best all-rounders in world cricket across formats. As a result, Shakib finds himself at the top spot of the ICC T20 all-rounder rankings. He’s also the second-highest wicket-taker in T20 international cricket with 140 wickets in 117 T20I games. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "With 47 wickets in 36 T20 World Cup games, Shakib’s record at the top doesn’t look like being breached any time soon, with the next highest among current bowlers being Ravichandran Ashwin (32) and Tim Southee (29). Shakib’s presence will continue to be pivotal to Bangladesh’s fortunes in this year’s T20 World Cup as they compete in Group D alongside South Africa, Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Netherlands. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "8.) Most Runs in T20 World Cups \n" +
        "As for the player with the record for most runs in T20 World Cups, is there really any name that comes to mind other than the King? \n" +
        "\n" +
        "With 1,141 runs across 27 T20 World Cup matches, Virat Kohli finds himself unmatched and peerless at the top, with the closest challenger (if you can call it that) being Rohit Sharma with 963 runs. What puts Kohli in a league of his own is his frankly ridiculous average of 81.5! With 14 half-centuries in 25 innings, a couple of which have been legendary, the legendary #18’s feats in T20 cricket’s showpiece make him out from the rest. How do you even argue a case that someone, with those numbers and that kind of match-winning innings and impact, can be left out of a T20 World Cup squad? \n" +
        "\n" +
        "While his superhuman feats have not resulted in a World Cup title yet, the latest edition will see Kohli’s and India’s quest for glory in the shortest format continue unabated in tandem. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "7.) Most Wickets in a Single Edition \n" +
        "Having talked about the most runs and wickets in the history of T20 World Cups, we turn our attention to the highest wicket-takers in a single edition. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "That record goes to Wanindu Hasaranga who starred for Sri Lanka with 16 wickets in the 2020 (2021) T20 World Cup. Hasaranga followed up his exploits in the UAE with 15 wickets in the 2022 edition in Australia. As a result, the Lankan spinner has shown his quality time and again on the biggest stage in T20 cricket. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "This time though, the competition is bigger and longer, and with plenty of quality spinners and bowlers in action, one can expect the returns of bowlers to increase within a single edition. Who knows, it could be Hasaranga who could break his own record yet again in the spin-friendly conditions of the West Indies and United States with his experience of playing in the Caribbean Premier League. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "6.) Most 4-fers in T20 World Cups \n" +
        "Picking up 4 wickets in a T20 game is a bowler’s delight, but some bowlers have made a habit of picking 4-fers in T20 games and especially in T20 World Cups. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Currently, the record for the most 4-fers in T20 World Cups is shared between Saeed Ajmal and Shakib al Hasan with each spinner having three instances of picking 4 wickets in a World Cup game. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The spin duo are closely followed by the pace duo of Anrich Nortje and Mustafizur Rahman who have picked 4 wickets in an innings twice in T20 World Cups. With Shakib, Nortje and the Fizz set to play in the 2024 T20 World Cup, it would be interesting to see if the Bangladesh skipper can script yet another record to his name or if his compatriot would usurp him to the record with his cutters and change-of-pace deliveries in the West Indies. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Nortje’s searing pace could also cause problems to plenty of oppositions and he too will look to scare the daylight out of batsmen along with the burgeoning South African pace battery in the West Indies. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "5.) Most Runs in a Single Edition \n" +
        "Once again, when it comes to runs in the T20 World Cups, only one name springs to mind and it’s that of Virat Kohli, that man again. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "With 319 runs in the 2014 edition, Kohli has the record for the most number of runs in a single T20 World Cup edition. Kohli’s insane consistency in T20 World Cups is characterized by his obscene average of 106.33 average in the 2014 edition. His runs in the edition in Bangladesh helped India on their way to the final where they eventually ended runners-up. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Kohli took his insatiable appetite for runs a notch further as he bagged 273 runs in the 2016 T20 World Cup at home at an average of 136.5, meaning he was dismissed only twice in the entire tournament! He then ended up with 296 runs in the last World Cup, once again at an average of 98.66 showcasing near invincible form when it comes to T20 World Cups. With the form that he has been exhibiting in the IPL this year, it’s just a matter of by how much than if King Kohli can once better his record set in the 2014 edition. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "4.) Most Appearances in T20 World Cups \n" +
        "The record for the most appearances in the T20 World Cup belongs to Indian skipper Rohit Sharma. The Hitman is the only player to feature in every edition for India and was part of the Indian team that won the inaugural edition in South Africa, where he announced himself to the world making a sparkling half-century on debut against the host nation. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The swashbuckling opener has featured in 39 games across the eight T20 World Cups. He also led the Indian team in the previous edition as they reached the semifinals. With 9 half-centuries and 963 runs across those games, Rohit has proved to be an integral part of the Indian outfit. Rohit will once again be in the spotlight as he leads the charge for the Indian team once again in the Caribbean and United States. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The closest challenger to Rohit’s record is Shakib al Hasan, with 36 appearances. But with Rohit and India expected to go deeper in the tournament, there seems to be no imminent challenge to the record held by the Hitman. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "3.) Highest Individual Score \n" +
        "Highlighting some more individual brilliance, we have the record for the highest individual score in T20 World Cups and it’s currently held by New Zealand legend, England Test team batting coach and the proponent emeritus of Bazball, Brendon ‘Baz’ Mccullum. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Blackcaps opener will forever be known among the most explosive openers in the game and gave evidence of his destructive ability by scoring a tournament-high 123 in just 58 balls, against Bangladesh in New Zealand’s opener in the 2012 T20 World Cup. Interestingly, Mccullum didn’t open this innings but still managed to score nearly 65% of New Zealand’s total of 191. Baz’s innings was laced with 11 fours and 7 towering sixes. His innings snuffed out any chance of an upset from Bangladesh, who folded for just 132 in their run chase. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "With plenty of explosive power on show in the 2024 T20 World Cup, there are plenty of names that could be in contention for breaking the record set by Mccullum 12 years ago. Could it be a New Zealander or someone else? Let us know your picks in the comments. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "2.) Highest Team Total in a T20 World Cup Game\n" +
        "Sri Lanka set the precedent for explosive batting in a T20 innings in their 2007 T20 World Cup group stage game against Kenya. The Kenyans were the sad victims of the Lankan onslaught as Sanath Jayasuriya smashed 88 in double-quick time before Mahela Jayawardene (65 off 27 balls) and Jehan Mubarak (46 off 13 balls) had their share of fun, before leading Sri Lanka to a mammoth 260/5 in their 20 overs. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The result was a foregone conclusion as the Sri Lankan bowling lineup made short work of Kenya, skittling them out for just 88 to bag a massive 172-run win. As a result of their humongous win, they set the record for the biggest win by runs in T20 World Cup history. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "1.) Highest Aggregate Score in a T20 World Cup Game\n" +
        "The final record that could very well be broken in the current edition is the record for the most aggregate runs in a single T20 World Cup game. That record was set by England and South Africa during their group stage clash in the 2016 T20 World Cup, at the Wankhede Stadium, in Mumbai. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Winning the toss, England skipper Eoin Morgan decided to field first. For a brief period, it seemed to be the wrong call as South Africa rode on half-centuries from Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock and JP Duminy to post a huge total of 229/4. It seemed a bridge too far for England against a bowling lineup consisting of Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Chris Morris and Imran Tahir. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But the new-look England, fresh from taking the burden of their chastening 2015 World Cup off their back, and under an attacking captain like Morgan, threw caution to the wind. Jason Roy set a whirlwind start for the English, scoring 43 in just 16 balls as England raced away to 89 runs in the powerplay, despite losing three wickets. Joe Root then played a match-winning knock, scoring 83 off just 44 balls as England pulled off a successful chase of South Africa’s mammoth target with two balls to spare. Root on the Man of the Match award for his pivotal knock that led to England’s successful chase. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "In doing so, England pulled off the highest successful run-chase in T20 World Cup history and also contributed to the highest aggregate score in a T20 World Cup game. 459 runs were scored across 39.4 overs, at an average run rate of 11.57 as the Wankhede played host to yet another high-scoring thriller. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But with teams being more and more aggressive and no boundary big enough to deal with the explosive quality of batsmen today, that total of 459 runs could well be in danger of being surpassed in the upcoming edition of the T20 World Cup. Which teams do you think will be part of the game that could break this record? \n" +

        "10.) A Win from the Jaws of Defeat \n" +
        "We begin at the 2010 World Cup semifinal in the West Indies where Pakistan faced Australia in the semifinal. The then-defending champions rode on half-centuries from the Akmal brothers (Kamran and Umar) to post an imposing target of 192 and were staring at an imminent win as Australia stumbled to 62/4 by the 9th over. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Requiring 129 from the remaining 11 overs against a formidable Pakistani bowling lineup seemed a bridge too far for Australia and all signs pointed to Pakistan heading to a hat-trick of T20 World Cup finals.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Cameron White restored some semblance of respectability on the Australian scoreboard, scoring 43. But his dismissal left Australia in a desperate position, needing 47 off the final three overs. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But then, Michael Hussey, the man dubbed “Mr Cricket”, took the fight to the opposition as he farmed the strike and made the most of it. Hussey hit Saeed Ajmal for 14 runs in the 18th over before smashing Amir for 16 runs in the penultimate over. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Requiring 18 from the final over, the left-handed southpaw saved his best for the last as he carted Ajmal for two sixes and a four before smashing him out of the stadium over long-on for a six of the penultimate ball to take Australia past the finishing line. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The left-hander brought Australia out of nowhere to victory with a stunning 60 off just 24 balls with three fours and six huge sixes. No doubt, Hussey was named the Man of the Match for his herculean efforts and showed why he is considered among the greatest finishers in the game. \n" +

        "9.) A Dutch Heist  \n" +
        "Who doesn’t like a good upset? The beauty of sport lies in its lore of David slaying Goliath and the opening game of the 2009 T20 World Cup produced just that. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Hosts England played the Netherlands in the curtain raiser of the second edition in a game that many thought would go as per the script, a comfortable England win. The English openers Ravi Bopara and Luke Wright ensured that the game stayed true to its expectations as they posted an opening partnership of 102 in just 11 overs. After Bopara’s dismissal, Wright continued to score 71 off 49 balls. But after the departure of the England openers, the innings lost all steam as the Three Lions huffed and puffed their way to 162, still a competitive total against an unfancied Netherlands side. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The hosts started well, restricting the Dutch to 66/3 in the 8th over. With 96 required from the final 11 overs and with England dominating the home conditions, the result seemed to be a foregone conclusion. But the experienced veterans in the Dutch lineup decided that wasn’t to be on their watch. They were playing at arguably the most iconic venue in cricket in Lord’s and were in with a chance of making history. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "As a result, the Dutch rallied on with Tom de Grooth’s 49 from 30 balls taking them to the doorstep of victory. With 7 needed from the final six balls, Stuart Broad had the ball in hand and Edgar Schiferli and Ryan ten Doeschate were tasked with taking the Netherlands past the finish line. A humdinger of a final over ensued with missed run outs, fielders and batsman running helter-skelter, Broad nearly bowling a no-ball and Netherlands somehow taking the equation to the final ball with 2 runs required. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Schiferli, on strike for the last ball, could only manage to squirt the ball out to the right of Stuart Broad and ran for his life. It was evident that Broad would make it before him, pick up the ball and have three stumps to aim at. For a brief moment, the Dutch looked on in helplessness, thinking they had spurned their chance at a famous victory. But Broad missed, no backup was at the stumps to flick the bails and off the ball went in the other direction giving the Schiferli and ten Doeschate the chance to complete the second run and continue to run around the ground in delirium after completing their Houdini Act. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Broad looked on, devastated at what had transpired, the England players looked shell-shocked, and the Dutch players looked shell-shocked of a different degree as they pulled off a heist in broad daylight at the Mecca of Cricket. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "8.) Where There’s a Will, There’s a Wade \n" +
        "Another day, another Australia-Pakistan semifinal clash, another classic. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "This time, we go back to the 2020 T20 World Cup when Australia overcame Pakistan from nowhere in yet another semifinal clash. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Chasing 177 for victory, Australia found themselves in trouble at 95/4 in 12 overs when Matthew Wade walked in to join Marcus Stoinis in the middle. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Requiring 83 to win in the remaining eight overs, Wade and Stoinis had their task cut out as they were the last recognized batting pair in the lineup and had to contend with a formidable Pakistan bowling lineup led by Shaheen Afridi. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Wade, in particular, started slowly, scoring just 8 runs in his first 10 balls. But with 50 runs remaining from the final four overs, the duo went into carnage mode as they ripped apart the Pakistan bowling attack. They were also helped with a few missed run-out chances and some sloppy fielding as the Men in Green let the position of advantage slip from their grasp, similar to the events that transpired 11 years ago. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Known for his tenacity, Wade found his attacking groove and smashed Afridi for 22 runs in the penultimate over, including three consecutive sixes that took Australia past the finish line and into the final of the T20 World Cup. While Pakistan looked on, crestfallen and disconsolate, the unrelenting, ruthless mentality so reminiscent of Australian teams and their successes in the big moments saw them trounce the existing narrative once again. Wade received the Man of the Match award for his heroic 41 off just 17 balls with his final seven balls yielding 33 runs to the Aussies’ winning cause. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "7.) A Dutch Heist - Ep. 2 \n" +
        "We are back with another episode of A Dutch Heist and this time it was their shock win against South Africa in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sent in to bat first, the Netherlands rode on innings from Colin Ackermann (41), Tom Cooper (35) and Stephan Myburgh (37) to post a total of 158/4 in their 20 overs. While it wasn’t a bad total, it seemed a little too thin for the batting might of the South Africans. The Proteas, who needed a win to get a semifinal spot, found themselves in a tricky position at 90/4 in 12.3 overs, but with 69 required from 45 balls and with their two most destructive batsmen in David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen to come, the task still seemed well within South Africa’s reach. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But as has been characteristic of the Proteas in World Cups, they inexplicably botched their chase to end up 13 runs short of the target. The Dutch had Brandon Glover to thank as the pacer picked up the key wickets of Quinton de Kock, Rilee Roussouw and David Miller to put the brakes on the Proteas’ chase (interestingly, Glover is of South African descent, having been born in Johannesburg. Bas de Leede dismissed Heinrich Klaasen in the 18th over to erase any chances of a South African triumph as the Dutch once again basked in the glory of usurping another major opposition, as they did 13 years ago in the opening game of the 2009 T20 World Cup. Only this time, they did it more convincingly. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "6.) No Universe Boss, No Party \n" +
        "Any discussion about T20 cricket is incomplete without the Universe Boss, Chris Gayle. No one’s had a bigger impact on the shortest format of the game like the big Jamaican who holds nearly every record in the format and is considered by many to be the Bradman of the T20 format. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The man for the big stage showcased why he is the global face of T20 cricket with a virtuoso performance in the opening game of the inaugural edition of the T20 World Cup in 2007. Sent into bat first, the Universe Boss was a one-man wrecking crew as he put the South African bowlers to the sword and spectators at the Wanderers Stadium gaping in awe of his pyrotechnics. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "In 75 minutes of batting, Gayle showcased the power and frenzy of the T20 format laying down the marker for batting in the shortest format. He ended up scoring 117 of 57 balls, with 7 fours and 10 humongous sixes as he made the Wanderers his stage to make people realize the magic of T20 cricket and its poster boy’s innate ability to do something special even within a space of just 120 balls (or rather 57). \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Although Gayle’s innings couldn’t stop South Africa from chasing the Windies’ target of 206 (thanks to Herschelle Gibbs’ 90), his innings was so good that he received the Man of the Match award for his innings that set the precedent and the pedestal for T20’s cricket’s ascendancy on the global cricketing stage. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "5.) When the King Took Down the Aussies\n" +
        "We move on to a showdown in the 2016 T20 World Cup between the two most successful nations in ICC tournaments. Australia and India faced off in a winner-takes-semifinal-spot clash at the PCA Stadium, in Mohali. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Batting first, the Victorian duo of Aaron Finch and Glenn Maxwell scored 43 and 31 to lead Australia to a total of 160 in their 20 overs. With 161 to chase, India had to win to keep their hopes for a semifinal spot alive. But they struggled in their chase as India stuttered to 94/4 in 14 overs, making a seemingly comfortable target of 161 look unsurmountable. Australia too tightened the noose around the Indian chase with spirited bowling and fielding as Shane Watson bowled a miserly spell of 2/23 in his 4 overs. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But with the chase master Virat Kohli and the finisher MS Dhoni joining hands, the result was more a matter of when than if. It was a situation tailor-made for the duo who put the Australian fielders on the tightrope with some darted running between the wickets. Kohli was at his otherworldly best and continued his love affair with chasing targets. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "With 39 left from the final three overs, Kohli hit 19 off the 18th over from Faulkner and then creamed Nathan Coulter-Nile for four boundaries in the 19th over to put India in the driver’s seat. The King oozed class with each passing delivery and in MS Dhoni, he had a partner who pushed him to the edge. The running between the wickets was a symphony and the duo’s brilliance made the crowd look on in awe as Kohli went about producing a masterclass.  \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Like death and taxes being constants in life, so is Dhoni finishing a game. The legendary #7 put the finishing touches to a sensational win as India rode on Kohli’s magnificent knock of 82* from just 51 balls to overcome a stubborn Australian team to make it to the semifinals of the World Cup. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Any guesses who the Man of the Match was? \n" +
        "\n" +
        "3.) Painting the World Blue \n" +
        "No game captivates audiences across the globe like India vs Pakistan and the 2007 T20 World Cup which brought global fanfare to the shortest format, awaited its grandstand finish between the two old rivals. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Sent into bat first, India missed out on the services of the influential Virender Sehwag but his opening partner-in-crime Gautam Gambhir stood out and shepherded the Indian innings with a match-winning 75 off 54 balls. A late cameo from Rohit Sharma (30 off 16 balls) helped guide India to 157. Umar Gul starred for Pakistan with figures of 3/28 in his 4 overs. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Stepping out for the chase, Imran Nazir gave Pakistan a brisk start to Pakistan’s innings, but RP Singh and Irfan Pathan swung the contest India’s way (literally and metaphorically) by breaking the back of the Pakistan batting attack. In no time, the duo, along with Joginder Sharma, put Pakistan up at 77/6 with Shahid Afridi losing his head amidst the heat of battle and skying an unnecessary shot straight down to Sreesanth at mid-on. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But Misbah-ul-Haq, who had brought Pakistan from a grim situation to a tie when the two teams met earlier in the group stage, continued to stay defiant with the tail. The right-hander smashed three sixes off Harbhajan’s 17th over to bring Pakistan closer and closer to victory. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "With 13 needed from the final over and India needing a wicket to win the game and the title, Dhoni was placed in a quandary. His best bowlers, RP Singh and Irfan Pathan, had bowled out and he only had Joginder Sharma and Harbhajan Singh to choose from. Dhoni went with the former and the move seemed to be a mistake as Sharma bowled a wide before being hit for a six over his head to bring the equation to 6 from 4 balls. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Just when it seemed like Misbah was once again the hero for Pakistan, he inexplicably played a cheeky flick to try and beat the man at fine leg. But Sharma saw the ploy and bowled the ball slower to force Misbah put all his power into the shot. As Misbah’s shot scooped up into the Johannesburg sky, hearts skipped a beat, breaths awaited for later, and a deafening silence wrapped the boisterous ‘Bullring’ for a second which was enough time for Sreesanth to settle himself under the ball and pouch the ball to script a moment whose magnitude and ripple effect will be felt in Indian cricket for posterity. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Misbah sank to the ground as the Indian players enveloped each other in jubilation around him. It served as a picture-perfect moment for a revolutionary change as the tidal wave of T20 cricket took over the world with India riding on its crest. It also signalled the start of an era in Indian cricket under the leadership of a star-eyed, long-locked MS Dhoni. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "4.) Madness at the MCG \n" +
        "There are games, there are close games, there are close India-Pakistan games, there are classics, there’s the T20 World Cup final and then there’s the game between the two sworn rivals at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "As if the game needed any further significance, it got the arena it deserved as nearly 1 lac people turned up for the Group stage clash and as it always does, cricket delivered! And it delivered not a game, but a tapestry of emotions, of individual brilliance, of hope, of despair and of sentiment that transcends sport. Cricket delivered perhaps its greatest action flick at its most iconic arena, and one man stood tall among the gladiators at the joust, raising his blade amidst the raucous applause at the Colosseum of Cricket. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Winning the toss, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma decided to field first, and his decision reaped immediate rewards as Arshdeep Singh dismissed the dangerous opening duo of Babar Azam (trapped LBW for a golden duck) and Mohammad Rizwan to put India in a position of advantage. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But Shan Masood and Iftikhar Ahmed steadied the ship with a 76-run partnership that helped Pakistan enroute to setting a target of 160. Pakistan fancied their chances with their three-pronged pace attack of Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf and the big boundaries at the MCG. The trio came all guns blazing as they restricted India to 31/4 in the powerplay. The boisterous Indian crowd finally went through a period of deafening silence as the Pakistani pacers tightened the noose around the Indian batsmen. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But Pakistan knew very well that it was a chase, and there was one key string to pull out if they were to win. But when it comes to chase, you best not miss at the King. And King Kohli reigned supreme once again. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The Delhi dasher joined hands with Hardik Pandya to course-correct the Indian innings as the duo matched their usual flair with sensible awareness of the situation. It helped them stitch a match-winning 113-run partnership that was laced with memorable shots and the steadfastness of two men who stopped at nothing to chase down the target despite everything that the quality Pakistan bowling attack threw at them. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "As Ashwin came out to bat in the final over, his words for Kohli’s intent that day summed up what Kohli is all about. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "“I came out to bat and I saw Virat’s eyes and he seemed possessed.”\n" +
        "Ravichandran Ashwin \n" +
        "\n" +
        "But the moment of magic came an over before as India were still at an arm’s length from the target. Requiring 28 from 8 balls, the final two balls of Haris Rauf’s final over were critical, they were match-defining. Till then, Rauf’s figures read 3.4 overs, 2 for 24. The speedster had cast a spell on the Indian batsmen from which they struggled to come out. Kohli knew it was do-or-die time and it was his time to put on the superhero cape. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Rauf steamed in looking to finish off yet another superb over and thought he bowled another belter to Kohli. The ball sat about bail height pitched in line and slipped into Kohli’s arc. Out came the man with a raised swoosh over long-on and the deafening silence turned into delirious noises as India found their way back into the game. Rauf stood stupefied, not knowing what to expect, the next ball angled into Kohli’s pads and the man possessed flicked it beyond fine leg for another six to bring the equation to 16 off 6 balls. The King had brought his empire down from the abyss. Cut to the last ball, as Ashwin sent the Kookaburra flying over mid-off, he knew he had done his job. India knew what they had just achieved. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Kohli sank to the ground, soaking in the applause and knowing the undertones beneath. The heralds that spoke ill during his poor run of form for three years before this game, the voices that drowned his superhuman ability in self-doubt and the same mouths that once called for his head, now waxed lyrical of his brilliance. Kohli turned things around in typical heroic fashion as he led India to yet another historic win over a Pakistan side that knew that it all came down to a force of nature that stood between them and victory. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "2.) Carlos Brathwaite. Remember the Name! \n" +
        "\n" +
        "“It almost felt like divine intervention”\n" +
        "Carlos Brathwaite \n" +
        "\n" +
        "We’ve come across eras where staying the course, occupying the crease for a long time and old-school resilience were ingrained in the psyche of cricketers. Hitting the ball anywhere but the ground would bring about the old-school rage of coaches. And the impact created across formats would be felt through spending long hours in the middle. Cut to today and all you need to create an impact is just a matter of 2-3 balls, that was the case with Carlos Brathwaite as well. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "As England took the West Indies on in the 2016 T20 World Cup at the Eden Gardens, in Kolkata, it was a battle to determine the first team to win two T20 World Cups. Batting first, England got themselves to 155, thanks to a fighting 54 from Joe Root and a quickfire 36 from Jos Buttler. For the Windies, Dwayne Bravo and Brathwaite picked three scalps apiece restricting a strong England side to a modest total. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "It was anything but as Johnson Charles, Chris Gayle and Lendl Simmonds were skittled out for loose change as the West Indies slumped to 11/3 inside 3 overs. They had to dig deep and find a way back into the game before launching themselves and that’s exactly what the experienced duo of Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo did, stitching a 75-run partnership. Samuels carried his bat through the innings before joining hands with Brathwaite for the final stretch of the chase as the West Indies required 45 off 24 balls. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "That equation came down to 19 runs in the final six balls and more importantly for England, they had Marlon Samuels off strike. That meant the pressure was on big Brathwaite who faced up to Ben Stokes. It was going to go right till the end without a clear winner in sight. But in just three balls, Brathwaite turned the equation, the crowd, his team, and destiny in his favour with three sixes, the first over backward square leg, the second over long-on and the third over long-off to leave West Indies needing just a run off the last three balls. Stokes looked crestfallen, not knowing what had hit him, but he still had to contend with the load of bowling the final ball. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "As the final ball sailed over long on for six, Brathwaite was a portrait, screaming triumphantly, arms out wide, arms that had turned the tide of destiny in his country’s favour, a nation divided in their priorities in cricket, but at that moment, everyone set their differences aside to come together and script a historic title win. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "As Stokes slumped to his knees, the West Indies ran around amok in excitement, taking in the moments to register the magnitude of their victory. The usually reserved Ian Bishop found his crescendo for once in the commentary box as he screamed those iconic words that have since stuck in pop culture. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "“Carlos Brathwaite. Carlos Brathwaite. REMEMBER THE NAME!”\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Ever since that fateful night, Stokes has also carved a career for himself that people will remember his name, but while he has carved his name in stone across a career, the moment and the ripple effect of it will always stay with the West Indies, Ian Bishop and mostly importantly, big Carlos Brathwaite. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "1.) Yuvraj’s Six Sixes \n" +
        "If hitting four sixes in a single over makes you a legend, what does hitting six sixes in an over make you? Immortal? Peerless? \n" +
        "\n" +
        "For Yuvraj Singh, these epithets do not matter as much as his pride which was at stake when big Andrew Flintoff squared up to him in between overs in India’s second Super 8 stage game against England. As Yuvraj walked up to Flintoff to try and put him in his place in an animated conversation with the English all-rounder, the umpires and skipper Dhoni restrained him and made him realise the wiser that the best way to get back was with the bat. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "He set his sights on Stuart Broad before unleashing carnage around Kingsmead. With a strong start from Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag propelling them ahead, Yuvraj’s first two sixes allowed India to dream of a big total, but little did they know that it was just a prelude on Yuvraj’s mind as he sent the first ball soaring over covers and the second behind fine leg. The third, a wide full toss, was dispatched over deep backward point and planted a seed for something special in the minds of the bemused spectators and even Yuvraj’s own teammates. He surely wasn’t going for the full monty, was he? \n" +
        "\n" +
        "A long meeting ensued between Broad and skipper Paul Collingwood, but it yielded no result as Yuvraj sent the fourth ball over mid-wicket for a maximum. Longer meeting, fifth ball, longer six over deep square leg. Five balls, five sixes. For a moment, the results, the bowler, the fielders and the distances went out of the equation. The Prince of Indian cricket (as aptly named so) made the moment about himself and his arrogant confidence. It was the moment that turned the attention of the world on this young, rather unheralded crop of Indian players who threw caution to the wind and were ready to give one back to the big teams, in the big games. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The moment was also a significant shift in fortunes as Yuvraj smashed the final ball of the over to long-on to notch the sixth six in the over. 36 runs, the fastest fifty in T20I cricket and a 16-ball 58 that made the world sit up and take notice of the game-changing talent of Yuvraj Singh and how he became the spiritual leader of the Indian team in the inaugural T20 edition, heralding the start of a new era in a team that was ready to fight and not be pushovers on the world stage. It was not just six sixes by Yuvraj, but a transformative 7-8 minutes of action that set the shifts in the aggressive intent which characterized the approach of the new India in cricket. And one of the most iconic moments in World Cup history, so much so that it made Flintoff eat his words and embrace Yuvraj in a repentant gesture at the end of the game. All’s well that end’s well, eh? \n" +
